# fo4port-tracker
A jank github used to track issues with a large-scale project.

You can find these ports here: LINK

If you find any missing materials or models that don't work, please go to the Issues section and submit an issue. Please include the name of the pack, the name of the model, and the nature of the issue. An example issue submission would look like this:

"Vault Interior - Vault\Doors\vltgeardoor\vltgeardoor01.mdl - Weird missing texture blob above the catwalk, and missing texture cones around what look to be lights around the gear door."

I will push corrections periodically, and update this page as appropriate. Thanks for taking the time to help me solve these issues.
