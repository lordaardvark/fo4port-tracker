# fo4port-tracker
A jank github used to track issues with a large-scale project.

You can find these ports here: https://lordaardvark.com/html/assets.html?cat=Models&sect=Prop_Packs&asset=Fallout_4___Vault_Interior

If you find any missing materials or models that don't work, please go to the Issues section and submit an issue. Please include the name of the pack, the name of the model, and the nature of the issue. An example issue submission would look like this:

Title: "Vault Interior - Vault\Doors\vltgeardoor\vltgeardoor01.mdl - Missing Textures"
Comment: "Weird missing texture blob above the catwalk, and missing texture cones around what look to be lights around the gear door."

Please check to make sure the model you're reporting hasn't already been reported. And while it's annoying, I would kindly ask that multiple models being reported be split out to separate issues. Asking people (and myself) to read the lists of models in the comments for bulk reports is just more headache than it's worth. Keeping it one model per report makes it quick and easy for people to check if their report has already been made, and for me to check if a report has already been fixed.

I will push corrections periodically, and update this page as appropriate. Thanks for taking the time to help me solve these issues.
